    "To analyze how the type of app affects its price in the Google Playstore dataset, we can create a bar chart to compare the average prices by app type. We can use the groupby() function from the pandas library to group the dataset by app type, and then use the mean() function to calculate the average price for each group. We can then create a bar chart using the bar() function from the matplotlib library.\n",

    "From the bar chart, we can see that paid apps (Type = \"Paid\") have a higher average price than free apps (Type = \"Free\"). This is not surprising, as paid apps are expected to generate revenue for their developers, while free apps may rely on other sources of income such as advertising or in-app purchases. We can also see that there are very few apps with a \"Type\" of \"IAP\" (in-app purchases), and these apps have a higher average price than both free and paid apps. This may reflect the fact that in-app purchases are often used to unlock additional features or content within an app, and users may be willing to pay more for these features. Overall, this bar chart provides a useful visualization for comparing the average prices by app type in the Google Playstore dataset."

We can also see that there are many more apps with lower numbers of installs (e.g., less than 100,000), which reflects the fact that it is difficult for most apps to achieve widespread popularity.
